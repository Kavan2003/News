Start coding your app using flutter, using a bottom-up approach. Start with the basic UI and then move on to the more complex features.

For AI-Powered News Summaries, you can use NLP libraries like NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) or Spacy. For the recommendation system, you can use recommendation algorithms like Cosine Similarity or Collaborative Filtering.

For Real-Time News Map, you can use mapping APIs like Google Maps or Open Street Maps. For displaying the heatmap, you can use heatmap libraries like Flutter heatmap or heatmap.js.

For Citizen Journalism, you can use a cloud-based database like Firebase or AWS to store user-generated content and for user authentication.

Keep testing and refining your app as you go along. Make sure to test each feature thoroughly and fix any bugs that you encounter.

Your app will have the following functionalities:

Interactive News Stories
AI-Powered News Summaries
News Aggregator
Citizen Journalism
Real-Time News Map
ntegrate AI and other functionalities: Incorporate AI and other functionalities as needed, such as AI-Powered News Summaries, Real-Time News Map, Citizen Journalism, etc. Use existing libraries and APIs where possible to simplify the implementation.
